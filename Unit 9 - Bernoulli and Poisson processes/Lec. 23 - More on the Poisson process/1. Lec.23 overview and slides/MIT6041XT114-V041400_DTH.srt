2
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,970
In this lecture, we look in
some depth into various

3
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:06,690
properties of Poisson
processes.

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,030
These properties would be quite
hard to study if one

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,390
were to proceed just
analytically by

6
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,620
manipulating formulas.

7
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,930
However, by using memorylessness
and our

8
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,650
intuitive understanding of
what the Poisson process

9
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,770
really is, they become
quite simple.

10
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,550
And the mathematical
manipulations can be avoided

11
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,690
almost entirely.

12
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:33,150
We will start by arguing that
the sum of independent Poisson

13
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,080
random variables is Poisson.

14
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,250
But we will then establish the
much stronger statement that

15
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,650
if we merge two independent
Poisson processes, we, again,

16
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,500
obtain a Poisson process.

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,250
We will see that we can exploit
this fact to solve

18
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,130
some problems that would be
quite difficult otherwise.

19
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:58,820
Once more, intuitive reasoning
is the key.

20
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,040
Finally, we will spend some time
discussing a phenomenon

21
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,160
that goes under the name
of random incidence.

22
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,590
The Poisson process
has been running.

23
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,890
You show up at a certain time.

24
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,110
You look at the size of the
inter-arrival interval during

25
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,940
which you show up.

26
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,450
It turns out that this
inter-arrival interval that

27
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,810
you get to observe is
not a typical one.

28
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,260
It tends to be larger
than the typical

29
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,940
inter-arrival interval.

30
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,930
We will understand what exactly
is going on, build

31
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,240
some intuition, and realize
that this is a general

32
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,770
phenomenon that also shows up
in many other contexts.

33
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,020
